    "Recommender systems are one of the most common and easily understandable applications within machine learning and data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on information about users and contents (or items) and the preferences or tastes that users have for different contents, recommender systems make predictions about the interest that a user may have in new products that he may not have shown interest  in  (or bought) yet. This is called **personalised recommendations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the large amount of information that surrounds us, many companies have chosen to include these systems within their services to cope with this information and provide the user with personalised recommendations, content, and/or services.\n",

    "\n",
    "Amazon does not look at the characteristics of the products to see if one product is similar to another, but analyzes the users' preferences for the products to generate these similarities. In other words, if a user buys an iPad and jointly buys a case, when a new user buys the iPad, Amazon will recommend buying the case.

    "## 5.2 Training a model\n",
    "\n",
    "As Sklearn, to train a model we just need to define the model with its constructor and then use the `.fit()` method to train it. To train a model based on neighbours, Surprise includes the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [`KNNBasic`](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/knn_inspired.html#surprise.prediction_algorithms.knns.KNNBasic): this is the basic collaborative filtering algorithm we have seen before. It implements collaborative filtering based on users or content as defined by the `user_based` parameter of [`sim_options`](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/prediction_algorithms.html#similarity-measures-configuration).\n",
    "\n",
    "* [`KNNWithMeans`](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/knn_inspired.html#surprise.prediction_algorithms.knns.KNNWithMeans): the same algorithm as above but with mean correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [`KNNNWithZScore`](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/knn_inspired.html#surprise.prediction_algorithms.knns.KNNWithZScore): the same algorithm as the previous ones but with mean and standard deviation correction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When defining these models, Surprise allows us to select two parameters that affect the neighbourhood used to make the predictions. If we remember that the predictions are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{r}_{u,i} = \\frac{\\sum_{v \\in N_u^K} {\\rm sim}(u,v) r_{v,i} }{\\sum_{v \\in N_u^K} {\\rm sim}(u,v)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N_u^K$ are the $K$ most similar neighbours to the user $u$, Surprise lets us control this neighbourhood with these parameters:\n",
    "* `k`: number of neighbours (users/items) that are considered to make the prediction (this is the size of the set $N_u^K$). If a user has more neighbours, only the `k` most similar are used. And if it has fewer, only those are used, unless they are less than `k_min`.\n",
    "* `k_min`: minimum number of required neighbours of a user/item to make a prediction. For users/items with less than `k_min` neighbours, their predictions are maded based on their average ratings, i.e. on $\\bar{r}_{u}$ or  $\\bar{r}_{i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the class [`sim_options`](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/prediction_algorithms.html#similarity-measures-configuration) not only allows us to select a model based on either users or contents, but also allows us to define several metrics, imported from the [`similarities`](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/similarities.html#module-surprise.similarities) module, to find the most similar users or items to a given one. Specifically, it includes 4 metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `cosine`: Calculates the cosine similarity between all pairs of users (or items). For example, between users $u$ and $v$ this measure would be:\n",
    "$${\\rm sim}(u,v) = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in I_{u,v}}  r_{u,i}  r_{v,i}  }{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i \\in I_{u,v}} r_{u,i}^2  \\sum_{i \\in I_{u,v}}r_{v,i}^2}}$$\n",
    "where $I_{u,v}$ is the set of items that both users have scored.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `msd`: Calculates the similarity as the inverse of the root mean square distance between all pairs of users (or items). In this case the similarity between users $u$ and $v$ is given by:\n",
    "$${\\rm sim}(u,v) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\sum_{i \\in I_{u,v}}  \\left(r_{u,i} - r_{v,i} \\right)^2}$$\n",
    "where a $+1$ term is included in the denominator to avoid divisions by $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `pearson`: Calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between all pairs of users (or items), given by:\n",
    "$${\\rm sim}(u,v) = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in I_{u,v}}  \\left(r_{u,i} - \\bar{r_{u}}\\right)  \\left(r_{v,i}- \\bar{r_{v}} \\right) }{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i \\in I_{u,v}} \\left(r_{u,i} - \\bar{r_{u}}\\right)^2  \\sum_{i \\in I_{u,v}} \\left( r_{v,i} - \\bar{r_{v}}\\right)^2}}$$\n",
    "where $\\bar{r_{u}}$  and $\\bar{r_{v}}$ are the mean values of the user ratings $u$ and $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `pearson_baseline`: This is the same measure as before, except that instead of subtracting the averages from the ratings, it subtracts some mean coefficients that must be learnt (we will see later how to learn them). In addition, it includes a correction (*shrinkage*) to avoid overfitting effects when there are few common elements between users $u$ and $v$. With these changes this measure is given by:\n",
    "$${\\rm sim}(u,v) =\\frac{\\mid I_{u,v} \\mid -1}{\\mid I_{u,v} \\mid -1+Sh} \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in I_{u,v}}  \\left(r_{u,i} - {b_{u}}\\right)  \\left(r_{v,i}- {b_{v}} \\right) }{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i \\in I_{u,v}} \\left(r_{u,i} - {b_{u}}\\right)^2  \\sum_{i \\in I_{u,v}} \\left( r_{v,i} - {b_{v}}\\right)^2}}$$\n",
    "where ${b_{u}}$ and ${b_{v}}$ are the  mean coefficients of users $u$ and $v$ (which we will have to learn) and $Sh$ is the *shrinkage* coefficient which is a model parameter to be defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the similarity calculation includes the parameter `min_support` which indicates the minimum number of common items for the similarity to be calculated. If two users (or two items) do not have a minimum of `min_support` common elements scored, their similarity will be 0."

    "  * The problem of new users can be alleviated with a hybrid system that incorporates user demographic information to find similar users. Or asking new users for rating a minimum number of objects before the system can start working.\n",

Surprise includes a threshold on the minimum number of common scores between two users or items that are arequired to calculate similarities. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Computational cost of these models. As we have seen how these models work, to estimate the score of a user $u$ for an item $i$, we need to calculate the users who are similar to user $u$ (in a user-based model) or contents that are similar to item $i$ (in the content-based model). This computation is computationally expensive as it requires calculating the distances between all users or items (by accessing all scores of all users or items) in order to make an estimate; these models are known as **memory-based** and can only be used (from a practical point of view) if the database is not very large. To overcome this limitation, it is sometimes proposed to pre-compute these distances (knowing which users or items are similar to a given one), generating a **model-based** system, and then only averaging scores to predict new ratings. This scheme tends to work very well in content-based neighbourhood models since the similarities between items do not tend to vary over time; in fact, this is the scheme used by Amazon in its recommendation system and it is able to make recommendations on millions of products in a very efficient way.\n",

    "Surprise includes the implementation of this model within the [SVD](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/matrix_factorization.html) module where it provides a more generalised implementation; instead of considering that a score is estimated by the product of its associated latents ($\\hat{r}_{u,i} = \\bf{x}_u^{\\top} \\bf{y}_i$) the predictions are considered to be given by this model:\n",
    "$$\\hat{r}_{u,i} = \\mu +  b_u + b_i + \\bf{x}_u^{\\top} \\bf{y}_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the mean of the scores, ${b_{u}}$ and ${b_{i}}$ are the coefficients of means of user $u$ and item $i$, and $\\bf{x}_u$ and $\\bf{y}_i$ are the latent variables of user $u$ and item $i$. To learn all these parameters, Surprise minimises the mean squared error (as the generic ALS does), but using this new definition of  $\\hat{r}_{u,i}$ and learning all the parameters together. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the model includes a `biased` parameter that we can set to `False` if we want to remove all these biasing factors and recover the original ALS model. In addition, this model includes as input parameter the number of latents (number of components in the vectors $\\bf{x}_u$ and $\\bf{y}_i$), which we will have to specify through the parameter `n_factors` and as we will see will be critical to obtain good performance with this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Surprise includes the SVD method and has two variants of it ([SVDpp](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/matrix_factorization.html#surprise.prediction_algorithms.matrix_factorization.SVDpp) and [NMF](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/matrix_factorization.html#surprise.prediction_algorithms.matrix_factorization.NMF)) that allow, respectively, to work with implicit scores and to impose different restrictions on the latent factors. If you are interested and want to go deeper into these models, you can check the library documentation."
